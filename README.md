### 💬 About Me:

My name is Gabriel Barratt, I am a first generation college graduate that enjoys coding and learning more about virtual reality, software development, datascience,
and game UX/UI design! I was born and raised here in Colorado and was able to pursue my education only with the help of my family. I'm excited to share my digital portfolio with you, which includes a visual presentation highlighting some of my proudest projects from my time at university. I'll also be providing a list of the programs I'm comfortable using, as well as a PDF of my resume and links to my social media profiles. I hope this will give you a better understanding of who I am as a person and a professional.

### 💡 Interest

I find myself enjoying the work I do now as a backend developer, although I've always had a passion for frontend development and creating visually appealing interfaces that users can interact with. In addition to the creative side of code, I also have a love for virtual reality even if I know little about it. The prospect of being able to create immersive experiences through the combination of code and cutting-edge technology is truly exciting to me. As the world becomes increasingly digitized, I believe that virtual reality will play an even more significant role in the future of frontend development. I am eager to continue exploring this exciting field and pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the virtual world.

In order to get out of the house and be able to enjoy nature I dearly enjoy the outdoors that Colorado provides. Since my move to this state I have done many activities with my family. All the way from mountain biking, hiking, swimming, camping, fishing, and boat rowing.

As I became more interested in technology I couldn’t let go of playing video games. Along the way to picking my career I became more interested in computers and have found it interesting and fun to build my own rigs. I have built two pc’s so far, one that was a budget build and another one that I saved up my money for in order to get better performance than what I was using before.

### 🚀 Projects

An academic project that is still a work in progress and is still being done this year is my capstone project for NASA. The goal of the project is to model our solar system while projecting a travel path of a spacecraft through our solar system. There is no link to that github repo right now and will be public by the end of April 2023. 

Using a messaging platform called Discord we made a bot which is an extension of the application's capabilities. Now this bot integrated our very own gacha game and tracked the crypto Dogecoin with an API. All of these functions are called through commands called in a text-channel. 

Another project that I have worked on this year was with a partner for object oriented programming. We made a snakes and ladders game that was made in intelliJ where we used Java. The purpose of the game is to reach tile 100 in a 10x10 grid where there are various obstacles that could increase the number of tiles you go up, which are stairs or go back if you land on the head of a snake to the tail. Each players takes turn rolling a die until they reach the final tile.
